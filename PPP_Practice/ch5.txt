return function(arg1, arg2)

    obj of the function
	pre-condition:
	post-condition:

    a function must have a pre/post condition check-ups or at least written as comment to reduce errors

    arg1 & arg2 > 0 and arg1 = arg2*4 <- this is a pre-condition required by function to generate correct output

	post-condition is a check up to see whether the return value is accurate or not
